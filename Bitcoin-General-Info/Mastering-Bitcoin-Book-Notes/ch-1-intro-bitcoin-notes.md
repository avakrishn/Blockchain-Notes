#Bitcoin Introduction

###Notes on [Chapter 1: Introduction](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch01.asciidoc) of [Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition - Programming the Open Blockchain](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook)

## What is Bitcoin?
1. Bitcoin is a unit of currency and is entirely virtual
	* Bitcoin is used to store and transmit value between participants on the network

	* Bitcoin is fast, secure, and borderless
2. Bitcoin community
	* Bitcoin participants communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol through the internet

	* Bitcoin protocol stack, can be run on laptops, smartphones, etc 

	* A participant in the bitcoin network = anyone using a device running the full bitcoin protocol stack

3. Bitcoin keys
	* Users of bitcoin own keys = proves ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin network

	* Keys allow users to 
		- sign transactions to unlock the value 

		- spend bitcoin by transferring it to a new owner

	* Keys are stored in a digital wallet on each user’s computer or smartphone

	* Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin 

		- The control is entirely in the hands of each user
4. The creation and distribution of Bitcoin
	* Bitcoin is created through "mining" 

		- Mining = competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions 

		- Any participant in the bitcoin network can be a miner
			- By using computer’s processing power to verify and record transactions
		- About every 10 minutes a bitcoin miner validates the transactions of the past 10 minutes 
			- Reward: brand new bitcoin 
	* Distribution is a peer-to-peer system
5. How is bitcoin decentralized
	* Bitcoin mining decentralizes the currency-issuance and  replaces the need for any central bank.
	
6. **The 4 Pillars of Bitcoin:** 
	* A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)

	* A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)

	* A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance (consensus rules)

	* A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain (Proof-of-Work algorithm)
